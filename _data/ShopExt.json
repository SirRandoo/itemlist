They were received with hatred and hostility in the early years, until a prominent warlord of Yanxia, impressed with their valor, forged an alliance with the strange race and took them on as retainers. No matter where they came to be, with their innate martial prowess, they readily found employment as soldiers and carved out places for themselves within spheres of authority. Before long, the Raen had assumed a prominent role as warriors in service of countless great warlords, and their members spread across the Far East, from the lands of Nagxia and beyond the Ruby Sea to the isles of Hingashi, where they earned a reputation as legendary swordsmen. Yet not all chose this life. Some embraced a life of tranquility and solitude, settling in the deep valleys of Othard's mountainous eastern reaches. Others still desired to leave conflict behind completely, and availing themselves of Kojin wisdom, they created a great bubble of air at the bottom of the Ruby Sea, within which they built a village—Sui-no-Sato. To govern their fledgling society, they founded a system of hereditary rule led by the Ruby Princess, under whose guidance they live a life of seclusion, away from the turmoils of the surface.",

They initially tamed horses to serve as mounts, and it was this achievement which led to the Au Ra's decisive rise to dominance over the plains. When the Raen subsequently departed their ancestral home, they took with them the knowledge of rearing and riding horses to the lands beyond the Steppe. After the horse, the Au Ra turned their hand to taming the yol, and these new mounts saw them expand their dominion to the skies above the Steppe. The Xaela have to this day not abandoned their ancestral home, living a nomadic life as hunters and gatherers on the vast Azim Steppe. With suitable grazing land sparse, conflict between individual tribes is common, with tribes forming, disbanding, and dying off in a ceaseless cycle of war and bloodshed. At last observation, Xaela tribes numbered fifty-one, though there is a high likelihood that recently splintered or merged tribes have rendered that count outdated. Of late, rumors swirl of a swelling of tribes who pledge spiritual allegiance to the Dusk Mother, and the abductions that have followed.",
